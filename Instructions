# How to Create and Deploy the BeMyValentine Website

This website is intentionally very simple and easy to set up. You only need to change one part of the code, then use GitHub Pages to deploy it.

Step 1: Get the Code

Start by cloning or downloading the code from this repository:

https://github.com/Ryan-Adams57/BeMyValentine

Step 2: Edit the Recipient Name

Open the index.html file in any code editor.

Locate the header section of the HTML.

Change the recipient’s name to whoever you’re sending this to.

In my example, I used Heather, but you can replace it with any name you want.

Save the file once you’re done.

# Important: Do not rename the file. It must stay index.html for GitHub Pages to work properly.

Step 3: Create a GitHub Repository

Go to GitHub and click New Repository.

Choose any repository name you like.

Make sure the visibility is set to Public.

Click Create Repository.

Step 4: Upload the HTML File

Upload the index.html file to your new repository.

Commit the changes.

Step 5: Deploy with GitHub Pages

Go to Settings in your repository.

Click Pages in the sidebar.

Under Source, select:

Branch: main

Folder: /root

Save the settings.

GitHub Pages will now deploy your website automatically.

Step 6: View Your Website

Once deployment finishes:

Go back to Settings → Pages.

You’ll see a live link to your website.
